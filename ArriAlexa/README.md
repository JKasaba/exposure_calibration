# Exposure Calibration Factor

The exposure calibration factor is calculated based on the following equation:

\[ A = 0.18 \times L \times t \times \left(\frac{S}{N^2 \times K}\right) \]

where:
- **L** is the measured luminance in cd/mÂ²
- **t** is the exposure time
- **S** is the ISO setting
- **N** is the T-stop number
- **K** is a constant value of 12.5

This equation and its details are further elaborated in the following document:

The required camera data can be found in this document:

In this case, the exposure calibration factor was calculated as 0.3827/0.391.

Based on analysis of the scopes and images before and after the exposure calibration, the calibration is making a negligible difference.
